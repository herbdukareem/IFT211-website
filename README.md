# Hosting a Website on GitHub

To host a website on GitHub, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a GitHub account:** If you don't have one already, go to github.com and sign up for a free account.

2. **Create a new repository:** Once you're logged in, click on the "+" button in the top right corner and select "New repository." Give it a name and choose whether you want it to be public or private.

3. **Prepare your website files:** Make sure your website files are ready to be uploaded. This typically includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other assets (images, videos, etc.) your website requires. Organize these files in a dedicated folder on your computer.

4. **Upload your files to the repository:** Open the repository you created on GitHub and click on the "Upload files" button. Drag and drop your website files from the local folder to the GitHub interface. Alternatively, you can choose the "Choose your files" button to manually select the files.

5. **Commit changes:** After uploading your files, you will see them listed in the repository. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, provide a brief description of the changes you made, and click on the "Commit changes" button. This saves your files to the repository.

6. **Enable GitHub Pages:** Once the files are uploaded, go to the repository's main page. Click on the "Settings" tab, scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section, and select the branch you want to use for hosting your website. Choose the branch that contains your website files (often named "main" or "master").

7. **Configure the source:** After selecting the branch, click on the "Save" button. GitHub Pages will build your website from the selected branch.

8. **Access your hosted website:** GitHub will provide you with a URL where your website is hosted. It will be in the format "yourusername.github.io/repositoryname". Note that it may take a few minutes for the website to be live.

9. **Update and maintain your website:** Whenever you want to make changes to your website, you can simply upload the updated files to your repository, and GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and update your hosted site.

That's it! Your website is now hosted on GitHub and accessible to the public. Remember to keep your repository updated with any changes you make to your website files.
